/* REFERENCE DATA TYPES 
Arrays, objects

In primitive data types, each time a variable is declared, a new memory is allocated and the value is stored in this new memory. Each time a variable is assigned a value, the value is copied into a new memory location. Therefore changing one does not affect the other since they are all in different memory adddresses.
*/

let x = 5;
let y = 10;

x = y; // x = 10;
y += 5; // y = 15, x = 10;

/*
In the reference data types, the data itself is not stored in the variable but rather a reference to the data is stored in the variable.
In this case, assigning one variable to another does not copy the entire object to the other variable but rather the pointer. As a result, both variables points to the same data and the value of one variable will affect the other as well.

let ages = 
{
  kofi: 23,
  Yaw: 15,
  Ama: 11,
};


let footSize = ages; // pointer to object "ages" has been assigned to footSize. Two variables pointing to same object.
footSize.kofi += 2; // dereference(covertly) pointer to ages and modify object
ages.Ama = 12; // dereference(covertly) pointer to ages and modify object

console.log(ages); //output: [kofi: 25, Yaw: 15, Ama: 13]

/* PRIMITIVE AND REFERENCE DATA TYPES AS FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
    When you pass a primitive data type as an argument to a function, the argument is passed by value, that is the value of the variable is copied into the function parameters and therefore any change you make to the parameters does not affect the variable passed.

    On the other hand, if you pass a reference data type as and argument to a function, it is passed by reference and therefore when you modify the parameter values, you indirectly modify the data passed as well.

/* VARIOUS DEFAULT REFERENCE TYPES IN JS */

/*
  1. Object - represent all types of objects
  2. Array - represent arrays 
  3. RegEx = represent Regular Expressions that can be used to search for 
     partterns in a string
  4. Date - represents data and time
  5. Math - represent mathematical operations for calculations
