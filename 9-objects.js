    /* CREATING OBJECTS VIA CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION
        Constructor functions are normal functions and can be used to create objects when their call is prepended with the "new" keyword. The constructor function creates a new object and returns it.
        By default, the function returns an object even without a return statement.

        What makes the function a constructor function is when it is called with the new keyword; other than that, it is a normal function.

        Normal functions can also be called with the new keyword to create objects where as constructor functions can also be used as normal functions. But both instances are not necessary.

                Each constructor function internally manages a prototype, an object which serves as the basis for creating objects using the constructor function. 
                The prototype is stored in the prototype property of the function. If an object is created using that function, the object is based on the prototype stored there.

                After the object is created, the prototype of the object can be determined by using:

                     GivenObject.__proto__
                     Object.getPrototypeOf(givenObject)

                Similarly, givenObject.constructor can be used to determine the constructor used to create an object.
